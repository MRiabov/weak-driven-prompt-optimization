## Purpose

This constitution captures the technical standards, code quality expectations,
tribal knowledge, and governance rules for Weak-Driven Prompt Optimization. All features and
pull requests should align with these principles.

## Technical Standards

### Languages and Frameworks
Python 3.12 with DSPy. Strict schema validation during data transfer. On-cloud langfuse for observability.

### Testing Requirements
Black-box integration tests. I don't believe in unit tests - test the whole workflows with mock LLMs.

### Performance and Scale
Batch execution, doesn't matter. If appropriate, paralelize Openrouter calls since they are I/O bound.

### Deployment and Constraints
Localhost. Likely deployment via docker or any APIs are not at all necessary.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Any team member can propose amendments via pull request. Changes are discussed
and merged following standard PR review process.

### Compliance Validation
Code reviewers validate compliance during PR review. Constitution violations
should be flagged and addressed before merge.

### Exception Handling
Exceptions discussed case-by-case with team. Strong justification required.
Consider updating constitution if exceptions become common.
